# Nordic Climate Community and EOSC

EOSC Nordic activities and synergies with other EOSC projects such as EOSC-Life and EOSC-Pillar.

### EOSC-Nordic tool roadmap for the Climate community

Rather than reinventing the wheel, EOSC-Nordic chose to base its roadmap on the [EOSC-Life tools roadmap](https://github.com/eosc-life/tools-collaboratory-roadmap) and reuse as many components as possible for the Climate community. Strengthening collaboration with Galaxy Community and EOSC-Life is an integral part of its plan.
